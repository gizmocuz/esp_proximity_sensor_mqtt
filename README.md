# ESP8266 Proximity sensor
A project to read a Proximity sensor and output this to MQTT

In this example I connected it to a water meter

When starting this sketch for the first time, it will show up as a new WiFi access point where you need to connect to
Once connected, configure the parameters via the web interface

It also has a small build status overview via a build in web server

Use it as a boiler template if you wish!
