## ESP8266 Proximity sensor

A project to read a Proximity sensor and output this to MQTT

In this example I connected it to a water meter.

When starting this sketch for the first time, it will show up as a new WiFi access point where you need to connect to  
Once connected, configure the parameters via the web interface.

It also has a small build status overview via a build in web server.

Use it as a boiler template if you wish!

I mounted this with two large screws/nuts that are smaller than the holes in my watermeter.  
This way, it is very easy to take it out when needed.
